<h1>This is my http-server of LAC(161220062).</h1>
<h2>Keep Updating!</h2>
<p>The server now supports some webpages and parses different files correctly. What's more, from the competition in Hong Kong, I added the gzip feature in the server so that it could answer request more quickly and efficiently.</p>

<p>what it can do:
	<ul>
	<li>127.0.0.1:8080/hello show a hello world</li>
	<li>127.0.0.1:8080/bhello show a better hello world written in html5</li>
	<li>127.0.0.1:8080/add/X/Y to carry out adding X and Y</li>
	<li>127.0.0.1:8080/ enter the main blog where you have link to
		<ul>
		<li>127.0.0.1:8080/login login (after which you would see a little change in the header)</li>
		<li>127.0.0.1:8080/signup sign up a new account</li>
		<li><em>And Other New Features</em>. Feel free to click on them.</li>
		//and a small change would appear
		</ul>
	</li>
	</ul>
